# Netflix Clone

This project is a basic clone of the Netflix landing page, built using HTML and CSS. It aims to replicate the look and feel of the Netflix homepage, focusing on the user interface elements and layout.

## Features and Functionality

*   **Hero Section:** A prominent section with a background, title, subtitle, and email input with a "Get Started" button.
*   **Navigation Bar:**  Includes a logo (using a placeholder image path: `/project4/assets/img/logo.svg`) and "English" and "Sign In" buttons.
*   **Sections with Image and Text:**  Displays sections with images and descriptive text, mimicking the Netflix content presentation style. Includes placeholder image paths like `/project4/assets/img/tvimg1.png`, `/project4/assets/img/img3.png`, and `/project4/assets/img/img4.jpg`.
*   **Video Integration:** Contains embedded videos using the `<video>` tag, with a placeholder video path `/project4/assets/videos/Five Nights at Freddy s 2 Official Teaser.mp4`. The video is set to autoplay, loop, and be muted.
*   **FAQ Section:** A "Frequently Asked Questions" section with toggleable answers (currently, the FAQ functionality is only visual, without interactive toggling).
*   **Footer:** A basic footer with links to various Netflix-like resources (FAQ, Investor Relations, etc.).

## Technology Stack

*   **HTML:**  For structuring the content and layout of the page.
*   **CSS:**  For styling the elements and creating the Netflix-like visual appearance (styling is expected to be found in `style.css`, but wasn't provided).
